**Math Chatbot README**
Overview
This project is a voice-activated Math Chatbot that uses Google's Generative AI Model and the Speech Recognition library to process spoken math-related queries and respond to them in real time. The bot converts voice input to text, sends it to the chatbot model for processing, and then reads the response aloud using text-to-speech functionality.

Features:
Converts spoken math queries to text
Uses Google Generative AI to process the text and generate responses
Reads chatbot responses aloud using a text-to-speech engine
Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

Google Cloud AI Studio: Create a project and get access to the API.
Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Python Libraries:
Install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install google-generativeai speechrecognition pyttsx3
google-generativeai: To interface with Google's AI chatbot model.
speechrecognition: To capture and convert voice input into text.
pyttsx3: To convert text to speech for voice output.
Other Requirements: Ensure you have microphone access and internet connectivity to use the SpeechRecognition API.
Setup Instructions
Google Cloud AI Studio:

Access your API key from Google Cloud AI Studio.
Replace Enter your key! with your actual API key in the code under the genai.configure(api_key="Enter your key!") line.
Model Configuration:

The chatbot's output behavior is controlled by the generation_config dictionary. You can adjust these settings (e.g., temperature, top_p, top_k, etc.) to modify the chatbot's response style.
The chatbot model is pre-configured to use a tuned model (mathchatbot-m4ggorut00v8). Do not change the model unless you have another suitable one.
Running the Code:
**
Ensure your microphone is working properly.**
Run the Python script, and the chatbot will begin listening for your voice input.
Speak your query aloud, and the chatbot will respond with a math-related answer.
Text-to-Speech:
The function SpeakText() will convert the chatbotâ€™s text response into speech and read it aloud.
Exception Handling
The code includes error handling to manage issues with voice recognition and API responses:
sr.RequestError: Handles API request errors.
sr.UnknownValueError: Handles unrecognized speech input.
Notes
Microphone Access: Ensure you allow microphone access for the bot to capture your voice.
Ambient Noise: The chatbot adjusts its noise threshold based on the environment using r.adjust_for_ambient_noise() for better recognition.
Usage Example
After running the code, follow these steps:

Say something related to math, like "What is the derivative of x squared?"
The chatbot will process your query and respond with an answer through text-to-speech.
The response will also be printed in the terminal.
